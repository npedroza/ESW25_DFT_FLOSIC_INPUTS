# ESW25_DFT_FLOSIC_INPUTS
ESW25 - Documents and Input files

Since we use desktop computers, we will use only 4 cores for these examples.

You can run the code using the command:

`mpirun -np 4 ~/Desktop/PublicRelease\_2020/flosic/nrlmol\_exe > print`        

or

`~/Desktop/PublicRelease\_2020/flosic/nrlmol\_exe > print`        

  
In each example directory, there is a sub-directory named start with the required input files.  
When you are in the example directory, you can copy the input files by doing `cp start/* .`
